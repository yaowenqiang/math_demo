# Overflow

> CPU register overflow flag

> install microsoft calculator for android

## overflow operation

=
-
*
/
%
left shifting

% and other bitwise ops can't cause overflow


if both operands are < 50% the capacity of the data type,
Then no overflow is possible

1/n can be represented exactly if the only prime factors of n are 2 and 5
because 10 = 2 * 5

> IEEE 754/IEC 60559:1989

0/0 is NaN
1/0 is infinity

NaA + anything = NaN
NaN * anything = NaN
4 + infinity = infinity
4/infinity = 0
infinity*infinity = infinity
